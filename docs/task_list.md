High-level tasks for the group portion of HW4 go here. I imagine it would be easier to fill these in during or after our next group meeting, but if you have some tasks you want to list now, don't feel the need to wait!

Descriptions should be 1 sentence at max according to the instructions.

We also need to make a burn-down or burn-up chart once we have our tasks listed here.

Two spaces are needed after the first three lines of each task to make the markdown format correctly.

DELETE EVERYTHING ABOVE THE DIVDER BELOW THIS SENTENCE BEFORE TURNING IN!
