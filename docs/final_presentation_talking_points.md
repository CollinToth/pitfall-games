# Final Presentation Talking Points

## Introductions and Responsibilities

- Collin Toth: Unity/Git Integration, Level Design, and Enemy Design
- Mary Benton: UI/Menu Design
- Benjamin Brown: Systems and UI Design

## High Level Overview

- Unity-based 2D platformer
- Primary mechanic of attribute randomization on player death
    - Health
    - Movement speed
    - Jump height
- Classic platformer mechanics
    - Avoid falling in pits
    - Avoid horizontal contact with enemies
    - Jump on enemies to kill them

## Time Goals and Adjustments

- Time goals were largely met, with some changes
    - Creating level geometry and acquiring assets were combined into one step (tilemapping)
    - Implementing level completion was done near the end
    - Not as much "starting from scratch" was needed as anticipated
- The order of our development steps was not strictly followed
    - Asynchronous development and personal schedules to blame (not a bad thing, though!)

## Changes Since Midterm Presentation

- Removal of stock microgame level
- Music acquired for new levels
- Three new levels implemented
- Various menus implemented (main, pause, level selection, and control)
- Health system implemented
    - Knockback and period of immunity when colliding with an enemy
    - Respawn the player if health is one when colliding with an enemy
- Level transitions implemented
- New enemy type implemented
- Health display implemented

## Demonstration and Installation of Final Game

- Portable executable which can be run in place (Windows and macOS)
    - Download link for both platforms provided on Blackboard
- Display all three levels and how each other's work integrates into the game
- Each person will give quick overviews of their work when it is encountered
