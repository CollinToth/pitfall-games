# Pitfall Games

CIS 350 Spectacular Never Been Seen Before Super Awesome Game is a Unity-based 2D platformer for Windows (64-bit). Plays similarly to many classic and modern 2D platformers, with a twist. Every time the player dies, their movement speed, jump height, and health will be randomized on respawn. This allows the player to complete levels in ways that are not possible with the playable character's initial attributes. The game's levels include Deep Forest, Forest Town, and Floating City.
